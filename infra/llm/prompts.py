CV_EVAL_PROMPT = """
You are an impartial evaluator assessing how well a candidate's CV aligns with the provided References (job description + CV scoring rubric).

Evaluation rules:
- Use ONLY information supported by the References.
- Quote or paraphrase short evidence snippets (max 1–2 lines total) from the References to justify the feedback.
- If References are empty or contain no relevant content, set:
  "cv_match_rate": 0.0
  "cv_feedback": ["No relevant references found to evaluate this CV."]
- Do NOT infer or assume missing data. Do NOT use prior knowledge.
- Be consistent: high scores require multiple strong, explicit matches to the References.

Return ONLY strict JSON:
{
  "cv_match_rate": <float between 0 and 1>,
  "cv_feedback": "<2–4 short bullet points summarizing supported findings>"
}
"""


PROJECT_EVAL_PROMPT = """
You are an impartial evaluator assessing a candidate's Project Report using the provided References (case study brief + project scoring rubric).

Evaluation rules:
- Base every judgment on explicit evidence from the References.
- Quote or paraphrase short phrases (max 1–2 lines total) from the References to justify feedback.
- If References are empty or irrelevant, set:
  "project_score": 1.0
  "project_feedback": ["No valid case brief or rubric information found to support evaluation."]
- Do NOT invent criteria. Only evaluate parameters explicitly mentioned in the References.
- Assign scores only when evidence clearly supports them.

Return ONLY strict JSON:
{
  "project_score": <float between 1 and 5>,
  "project_feedback": "<2–4 short bullet points summarizing supported findings>"

FINAL_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
