CV_EVAL_PROMPT = """
You are an impartial evaluator assessing how well a candidate's CV aligns with the provided References.

The References may contain mixed documents (Job Description, CV Scoring Rubric, Project Scoring Rubric, Case Brief). For THIS TASK:
- USE ONLY: Job Description (JD) and sections of the Rubric that clearly pertain to CV evaluation / candidate skills & experience (CV-related rubric sections).
- IGNORE ANYTHING about Project deliverables, project scoring, code quality, chaining, RAG, or case-brief requirements.

Evaluation rules:
- Base every judgment ONLY on the allowed References above.
- Quote or paraphrase short evidence snippets (max 1–2 lines total) from the References to justify the feedback
- If References are empty or contain no relevant content, set:
  "cv_match_rate": 0.0
  "cv_feedback": ["No relevant references found to evaluate this CV."]
- Do NOT infer missing data. Do NOT use prior knowledge.
- Be consistent: high scores require multiple strong, explicit matches to the allowed References.

Return ONLY strict JSON:
{
  "cv_match_rate": <float between 0 and 1>,
  "cv_feedback": "<2–4 short bullet points summarizing supported findings>"
}

PROJECT_EVAL_PROMPT = """
You are an impartial evaluator assessing a candidate's Project Report using the provided References.

The References may contain mixed documents (Job Description, CV Scoring Rubric, Project Scoring Rubric, Case Brief). For THIS TASK:
- USE ONLY: Case Study Brief and sections of the Rubric that clearly pertain to Project evaluation / deliverables (Project-related rubric sections).
- IGNORE ANYTHING about CV match, candidate background, or generic hiring criteria unrelated to project deliverables.

Evaluation rules:
- Base every judgment ONLY on the allowed References above.
- Quote or paraphrase tiny evidence snippets (max 1–2 lines total) from the allowed References.
- If the allowed References are empty or irrelevant, set:
  "project_score": 1.0
  "project_feedback": ["No valid case brief or rubric information found to support evaluation."]
- Do NOT invent criteria. Only evaluate parameters explicitly mentioned in the allowed References.
- Assign scores only when evidence clearly supports them.

FINAL_SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
Synthesize the CV evaluation and Project evaluation into a 3-5 sentence overall summary.

CATALOG_PROMPT = """You are standardizing a job description title for a vector catalog.

INPUT (raw title + first-page summary):
---
{raw}

Return STRICT JSON with:
- title: concise, standardized job title (e.g., "Product Engineer (Backend)")
- aliases: 8-12 alternative natural-language titles, including:
  - Exact role titles (e.g., "Backend Engineer", "Backend Developer")
  - Senior/Junior variants (e.g., "Senior Backend Engineer")
  - Domain-specific variants (e.g., "AI Backend Engineer")
- tags: 5–10 short, domain-relevant lowercase keywords extracted from the text (not from examples or imagination). Each tag should be concrete and informative (e.g., 'backend', 'api', 'cloud', 'security', 'fintech', 'data', 'design', 'hardware', etc.).
- job_key: kebab- or snake-case stable identifier derived from the title and specialization; include a version suffix '-v1'. Example: 'backend-pe-v1'.

Guidelines:
- Do NOT hallucinate technologies or domains not mentioned in the input.
- Do NOT reuse tags from examples unless they are clearly relevant.
- The JSON must be valid and self-contained.
- Output ONLY JSON. No prose.
