2025
Rakamin is hiring a Product Engineer (Backend) to work on Rakamin. We're looking for dedicated engineers who write code
they’re proud of and who are eager to keep scaling and improving complex systems, including those powered by AI.
About the Job
You'll be building new product features alongside a frontend engineer and product manager using our Agile methodology, as
well as addressing issues to ensure our apps are robust and our codebase is clean. As a Product Engineer, you'll write clean,
efficient code to enhance our product's codebase in meaningful ways.
In addition to classic backend work, this role also touches on building AI-powered systems, where you’ll design and orchestrate
how large language models (LLMs) integrate into Rakamin’s product ecosystem.
Here are some real examples of the work in our team:

• POST /upload
◦ Accepts multipart/form-data containing the Candidate CV and Project Report (PDF).
◦ Stores these files, return each with it’s own ID for later processing.
• POST /evaluate
◦ Triggers the asynchronous AI evaluation pipeline. Receives input job title (string), and both document ID.
◦ Immediately returns a job ID to track the evaluation process.
{
"id": "456",
"status": "queued"

• GET /result/{id}
◦ Retrieves the status and result of an evaluation job. This endpoint should reflect the asynchronous, multi-stage nature
of the process.

▪ While queued or processing

▪ Once completed

◦ Retrieve relevant sections and inject into prompts (e.g., “for CV scoring” vs “for project scoring”).
• Prompt Design & LLM Chaining

◦ CV Evaluation
▪ Parse the candidate’s CV into structured data.
▪ Retrieve relevant information from both Job Description and CV Scoring Rubrics.
▪ Use an LLM to get these result: cv_match_rate & cv_feedback
◦ Project Report Evaluation
▪ Parse the candidate's Project Report in
V Scoring Rubrics.
▪ Use an LLM to get these result: cv_match_rate & cv_feedback
◦ Project Report Evaluation
▪ Parse the candidate's Project Report into structured data.
▪ Retrieve relevant information from both Case Study Brief and CV Scoring Rubrics.
▪ Use an LLM to get these result: project_score & project_feedback
◦ Final Analysis
▪ Use a final LLM call to synthesize the outputs from previous steps into a concise overall_summary.
• Long-Running Process Handling
◦ POST /evaluate should not block until LLM Chaining finishes.
◦ Store task, return job ID, allow GET /result/{id} to check later periodically.
• Error Handling & Randomness Control
◦ Simulate any edge cases you can think of and how well your service can handle them.
◦ Simulate failures from LLM API (timeouts, rate limit).
◦ Implement retries/back-off.
◦ Control LLM temperature or add validation layer to keep responses stable.

2025-10-07 23:40:41,745 [INFO] Project ref 3: Case Study Brief
Hello! Thank you for applying with us as a backend developer. This mini project should be completed within 5 days after you
have received this document. Please spare your time to complete this project with the best results. We are really pleased to
answer your questions if there are unclear things.
Objective
Your mission is to build a backend service that automates the initial screening of a job application. The service will receive a
candidate's CV and a project report, evaluate them against a specific job description and a case study brief, and produce a
structured, AI-generated evaluation report.
Core Logic & Data Flow
The system operates with a clear separation of inputs and reference documents:
Candidate-Provided Inputs (The Data to be Evaluated):
1. Candidate CV: The candidate's resume (PDF).
2. Project Report: The candidate's project report to our take-home case study (PDF)
System-Internal Documents (The "Ground Truth" for Comparison):
1. Job Description: A docu
candidate's project report to our take-home case study (PDF)
System-Internal Documents (The "Ground Truth" for Comparison):
1. Job Description: A document detailing the requirements and responsibilities for the role — You can use the job description
you’re currently applying. This document will be used as ground truth for Candidate CV.
◦ To make sure the vector retrieval is accurate enough, you might need to ingest a few job description documents as well.
2. Case Study Brief: This document. Used as ground truth for Project Report. (PDF)
3. Scoring Rubric: A predefined set of parameters for evaluating CV and Report, each has it’s own documents. (PDF)
We want to see your ability to combine backend engineering with AI workflows (prompt design, LLM chaining, retrieval,
resilience).
Deliverables
1. Backend Service (API endpoints)
Implement a backend service with at least the following RESTful API endpoints:
• POST /upload
◦ Accepts multipart/form-data containing the Candidate CV and Project

2025-10-07 23:41:30,181 [INFO] Project ref 3: ackend service with at least the following RESTful API endpoints:
• POST /upload
◦ Accepts multipart/form-data containing the Candidate CV and Project Report (PDF).
◦ Stores these files, return each with it’s own ID for later processing.
• POST /evaluate
◦ Triggers the asynchronous AI evaluation pipeline. Receives input job title (string), and both document ID.
◦ Immediately returns a job ID to track the evaluation process.
{
"id": "456",
"status": "queued"
}
• GET /result/{id}
◦ Retrieves the status and result of an evaluation job. This endpoint should reflect the asynchronous, multi-stage nature
of the process.
◦ Possible responses:
▪ While queued or processing
{
"id": "456",
"status": "queued" | "processing"
}
▪ Once completed
{
"id": "456",
"status": "completed",
"result": [redacted-example]
}
2. Evaluation Pipeline
Design and implement an AI-driven pipeline which will be triggered by [POST] /evaluate endpoint. Should consist these key
Components:
• RAG (Context Retrieval)
◦ Ingest all System-Internal Documents (Job Description, Case Study Brief, Both Scoring Rubrics) into a vector
database.
◦ Retrieve relevant sections and inject into prompts (e.g., “for CV scoring” vs “for project scoring”).
• Prompt Design & LLM Chaining
The pipeline should consists of
◦ CV Evaluation
▪ Parse the candidate’s CV into structured data.
▪ Retrieve relevant information from both Job Description and CV Scoring Rubrics.
▪ Use an LLM to get these result: cv_match_rate & cv_feedback
◦ Project Report Evaluation
▪ Parse the candidate's Project Report in
V Scoring Rubrics.
▪ Use an LLM to get these result: cv_match_rate & cv_feedback
◦ Project Report Evaluation
▪ Parse the candidate's Project Report into structured data.
▪ Retrieve relevant information from both Case Study Brief and CV Scoring Rubrics.
▪ Use an LLM to get these result: project_score & project_feedback
◦ Final Analysis
▪ Use a final LLM call to synthesize the outputs from previous steps into a concise overall_summary.
• Long-Running Process Handling
◦ POST /evaluate should not block until LLM Chaining finishes.
◦ Store task, return job ID, allow GET /result/{id} to check later periodically.
• Error Handling & Randomness Control
◦ Simulate any edge cases you can think of and how well your service can handle them.
◦ Simulate failures from LLM API (timeouts, rate limit).
◦ Implement retries/back-off.
◦ Control LLM temperature or add validation layer to keep responses stable.
